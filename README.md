# Spark Vending machine

Our company is growing very fast with many new acquisitions. We are trying to cope with all the demand our employees have for food and beverages.

We estimated that it would be too hard to acquire multiple vending machines and suite them to our needs, therefore we decided to build one on our own. We need your help to do some ground work!

You need to design a machine based on the following requirements:

 - We have an inventory of all available products, which can help us to see which products are still available
 - An employee can choose from different products: SparklingWater, SparkPasta, Sparksoda. All of them are for free.
 - When returning a product, an according item will be removed from the product inventory

### Development

- Use the language you feel most comfortable with – ideally PHP or Java
- There is no need to showcase usage of any major framework (Spring/Laravel/...) for the task. Feel free to do so, in case you feel it helps you getting things done.
- We need to ensure that any change we do is working, our employees would be disappointed if we roll out a non-functioning vending machine, and we do value their opinion. Thus, anything we deliver has to be in good shape and quality. Maybe TDD could be a feasible approach.
### Sending the task to us

You can choose to send the solution as a ZIP archive (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive) or upload it as a private repository to a GIT hoster of your choice, giving us access to it.

We are looking forward to your implementation! 😊
